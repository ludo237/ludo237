## Hi there 👋

I am Claudio Ludovico, entrepreneur, coder, investor and futurist.

📚 Being self-taught, I believe in life-long learning and knowledge sharing. 
I also deeply believe in the open-source movement and try to give back to the community whenever I can.

I am part of the ‘90s generation that grew up with the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and the Commodore 64. Understanding how stuff works is a passion that I showed since the age of 5, in fact I tried to assemble and disassemble both “Commodore” and “Amiga” with very positive results, but with a lot of anger as well. It was caused by the fact that the more parts I discovered, the more I could not understand how they worked.

When I grew up, lots of things became clearer and the field of computer science became my main passion. I started to get closer to the art of programming relatively late, around 16 years old, before, I dabbled only in programming micro C software on consoles, nothing important. The "hard" programming began exactly when I was 16. After that, I took a diploma in computer science in Italy then I started to study computer engineering in Switzerland at SUPSI where I learnt a lot of basic essential techniques for a good engineer. I'm deeply proud of my work and I strongly believe in continuous formation because technology never stops and I will not ever let it go too far from my passion.
